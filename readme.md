### Codeworks coding assignment

The next and last step to admission will be to write a little web-application to show your proficiency with HTML/CSS/JS. Check the following three options and pick one of them (whichever you like best):

Build a simple Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It’s a single page, that opens in the browser, and lets the user play. The rules for Blackjack are here, it’s a relatively simple game. Your implementation just needs to give the "hit" and "stand" options to the player (no betting), feel free to figure out what UI you prefer, as long as the user understands what is happening and can play multiple games.

Build a simple address book application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It is a single page, that opens in the browser, where the user can create new contacts, find existing contacts, or delete them. Each contact should have a name, surname, phone number, and address. The data doesn’t need to be persisted when the browser page is closed.

Build a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It is a single page, that opens in the browser, and shows the messages in colored bubbles (think something like WhatsApp). On one side the computer will generate a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages. The screen automatically flows and follows the messages posted, like in all chat apps.
